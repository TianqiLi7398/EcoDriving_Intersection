###Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator Design for Nonlinear Biological Movement Systems

W. Li, E. Tordorv

ILQR, optimal control, nonlinear control

#### intro

for most optimal control, they requires Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian formalism, while the biomechanical sys are non-linear. 

1. Apply iterative linearization around a nominal trajecory, 

2. computes locally optimal feedback control law via modified LQR technique

3. control law then is applied to linearized system

4. reusult is used to imporve nominal trajecorty incrementally

5. convergence of quasi-Newton method
